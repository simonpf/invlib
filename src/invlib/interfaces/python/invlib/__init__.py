"""
Invlib Python interface
=======================

The :code:`invlib` Python module provides a Python interface to the
 `invlib <http://www.github.com/simonpf/invlib>`_ library. It is designed
to provide an efficient implementation of the optimal estimation method
that computes maximum a posteriori estimates of Bayesian inverse problems.

Overview
--------

The main functionality of the library is contained in the :code:`oem`
 sub-module which provides the :code:`OEM` class which is used to
compute solutions of Bayesian inverse problems.

In addition to that, the library provides data types for vectors as well
as dense and sparse matrices that use efficient linear algebra routines
based on the Intel MKL libraries.
