/** \brief Proxy class for computing the product of two algebraic expressions.
 *
 * The MatrixProduct class template provides a proxy class template for the
 * product of two algebraic expressions. The class is basically a placeholder
 * that holds references to the matrices involved in the product. It is also
 * possible to build nested algebraic expression in which the operands may be
 * other proxy classes. In this case, copies of the operands are held by
 * the MatrixProduct object.
 *
 * The result of the product must be either of matrix type or vector type,
 * depending of the result type of the right hand operator. The computation
 * of the product is invoked, when the product is converted to its result type.
 *
 *
 * The class expects the right hand
 * operator to be convertible to either a vector or a matrix and the left
 * hand operator to provide the two member functions
 *
 * - VectorType multiply(const VectorType &) const
 * - MatrixType multiply(const MatrixType &) const
 *
 * \tparam T1 The type of the left hand side operator
 * \tparam T2 the type of the right hand side operator
 * \tparam Matrix The underlying matrix type used.
